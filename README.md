In this app, there are two tabs, the first and most important one being "Home" - it has some features for instant needs.

The green button let the medical staff know whether a patient is in need of a meal (if so - he will also be choosing the heat level).
The nurse will see the green light amount (between 1-10) and the number represents how warm the patient wants the food would be.

In case the patient is having an emergency, the system will turn the lights red and an emergency siren will play.
Once the staff will notice, they will cancel the alarm by pressing the left button (and of course they'll go straight to the patient and alert other medical staff if needed).
If the patient is cold he can ask for a blanket via the app (on the blanket button) and the blue lights will turn on - which will alert the staff to bring the blanket to the patient.

An employee notices a flicker of light when his manager assigns him a task under his responsibility under the task management tool, ClickUp. Then, by another tap after he saw the new task, he will send the task to ClickUp's "in progress" column.

Regarding the second tab - "Next Dose Timer", when patienta are in need to take medicine in specific times, they can set the timer to the next time they need to take it, then, once the time is up - an alarm will let the staff know and they will update the patient and give them their medicine as needed.  
  
In case there is a shift change of the medical staff, they will click for a few seconds on the right click and a push message will pop up and will let the patients know that their needs will be taken care of shortly.  
  
*As you can see, our platform is a 2-sided communication system of the staff & patients!*
